About Cookie
----

Cookie is a high-performance server of MCBE, written in Java, supports all features, and supports loading plug-ins. Cookie has a complete and easy-to-use plug-in api, which generally draws on the architecture of nk, and has made a lot of changes on this basis. This project is still under development. We welcome capable developers to join our development team (currently almost all of them are developed by me).
